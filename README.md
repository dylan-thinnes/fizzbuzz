A bunch of fizzbuzz implementations in interesting languages that I've thrown
together over the years.

Includes:

- brainfsck (turing tarpit)
- AWK (pattern scanning and processing language)
- J (array programming language)
- dc (reverse polish notation calculator)
- JQ (JSON querying and transformation language)
- Rust
- Haskell
- C
- Python

For some languages I have included different interesting solutions. Some
solutions accept numbers from stdin, others just print a predefined sequence of
values.
